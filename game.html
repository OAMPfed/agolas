                    AGOLAS is a 'Game of Thrones' inspired Snakes and Ladder type boardgame.
                    The game is simple. Align yourself with a house and become their champion in the ultimate
                    quest to become the ruling faction of the known world. Roll the dice and risk it all. Winnings are
                    coming.
                </p>
                <h2>The Rules</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>The player rolls a dice once per turn. If a roll results in 6, another roll is automatically
                        done.
                    </li>
                    <li>There are hidden traps that will trigger random events resulting in penalties. </li>
                    <li>The winner is the first player to land exactly on tile 30. Rolls that move past the final tile
                        will be subtracted and the player will move backwards until a roll lands on tile 30.</li>
